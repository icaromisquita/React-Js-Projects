# My ReactJS Learning Projects

This repository contains a collection of projects I've built while learning ReactJS. Currently, it features a Spotify clone project.

## Project List

* **Project 1: [Spotify Clone](spotify-clone/)**
    * Description: A simplified Spotify clone built using ReactJS. This project demonstrates my understanding of React components, state management, API integration, and basic UI design. It fetches and displays song data, and simulates basic playback functionality.
    * Key Features:
        * Displaying a list of songs/albums.
        * Simulated song playback.
        * Fetching data from a mock API (or a real API, if you've integrated one).
        * Basic UI elements mimicking Spotify's layout.
    * Technologies Used: ReactJS, CSS, (Potentially Axios or Fetch for API calls)
    * Installation:
        ```bash
        cd spotify-clone
        npm install
        npm start
        ```
## Learning Journey

This project documents my progress in learning ReactJS. It showcases my understanding of:

* Component-based architecture
* State management (useState)
* Event handling
* Props and component communication
* API integration (if api is used)
* Basic CSS styling.
